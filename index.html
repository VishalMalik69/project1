      <div id="wg3">
        <h1>To gain weight, you’ll likely need to consume additional calories.</h1>
        <p>Aim to eat 300 to 500 more calories per day if you want to gain weight slowly. It's better for your body to gain weight slowly than to put on weight quickly. Eating a surplus of 500 calories a day more than you burn results in a new pound of body mass per week.You can avoid overeating too much and make sure that the excess calories go to your muscles instead of just your fat cells by starting a resistance training program.<br> <br>
          Resistance training, or strength training, includes both bodyweight exercises and free weights. Resistance training leads to muscle hypertrophy, which increases muscle mass. <br> <br>
          Combining protein supplementation with resistance training can promote additional gains in lean body mass beyond those gained by resistance exercise alone. <br><br>
          One study found that protein supplementation during resistance training for six weeks increased lean mass growth by 27% in healthy adults. <br><br>
          If you’re completely out of shape or new to training, consider hiring a qualified personal trainer or taking a class to help you get started, if this is possible for you. <br> <br>
          You may also want to consult with a doctor if you have skeletal problems or any medical issues. <br><br>
          To maximize muscle mass, it’s best to focus on resistance training over cardio <br><br>
          Doing some cardio can help improve fitness and well-being, but you may want to avoid doing so much that you end up burning all the additional calories you’re eating. <br><br>

      <h1>How to do a weight loss?</h1>
  
      <p>
        In order to lose at least a pound a week, try to do at least 30 minutes of physical activity on most days, and reduce your daily calorie intake by at least 500 calories. However, calorie intake should not fall below 1,200 a day in women or 1,500 a day in men, except under the supervision of a health professional.Achieving healthy weight loss isn’t about a “diet” or “program” but a lifestyle with healthy eating patterns, regular physical activity, and stress management. Medications taken for other conditions may also make it harder to lose weight. If you are concerned about your weight or have questions about your medications, talk with your health care provider.</p> <br>
       <h2>Even modest weight loss can mean big benefits..</h2>
       

       <p>Even a modest weight loss of 5% to 10% of your total body weight is likely to produce health benefits, such as improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars. <br> <br>     
        For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, a 5% weight loss is 10 pounds, bringing your weight down to 190 pounds. While this weight may still be in the “overweight” or “obesity” range, this modest weight loss can decrease your risk for chronic diseases related to obesity. 
        So even if the overall goal seems large, see it as a journey rather than a final destination. You’ll learn new eating and physical activity habits that will help you live a healthier lifestyle. These habits can help you maintain your weight loss over time.</p>

       <div id="ms3">
        <p>To gain muscle, you need to provide your body with appropriate amounts of calories and nutrients, particularly protein. Doing so will support the creation of new muscle proteins from the dietary protein you eat, which will be stimulated by the work you do in the weight room.

          The main goal of eating to gain muscle during a bulking phase is supplying your body with enough nutrients to grow, but not so many calories that you put on more fat than muscle.
          
          While some minor fat gains tend to occur during periods of bulking, a sweet spot, where your body builds muscle but does not store large quantities of fat, tends to occur when you eat 300–500 surplus calories.
          
          Your body has a maximum muscle building rate, and beyond that limit, excess calories will be stored as fat. If your goal is to have defined muscles, you want to avoid gaining too much body fat.</p>
